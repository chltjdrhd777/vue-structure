# I believe

- Create React App is toooooo slow to do something
- It give me to change and use another platform
- So in this time, I am gonna try "vue"

- and I think Vue is clearer and neater than react

# awesome part of vue better than react

1. I can pack all files like js,css, etc in the one vue file. truely awesome
2. The layout system is great. because when I use react I should set the dirty codes like import import import on the first place above very dirty. but, vue shows the component first, and all script related files are in the "script" tag. dont you think it is clear and understandable?

3. really neat and light. compared to react, vue is almost rabbit speed in compiling. what the hack!

4. and It gives a considerable warning not like destructing all page and show the annoying error page, but shows me a slight transparent popup screen for my error. great!

5. and its own library is enormous and useful.

6. supporting application like snippets is really truely considerable.

Why not use this kind of awesome framework? I fall in love about it
